You're helping me run local Python solutions with custom test logic.

I'll paste a coding question and the associated test code (usually including function stubs, input objects, and a `main()` function or test function).

Do NOT solve the problem. Instead, convert the code and tests into a single `main.py` scaffold that I can copy-paste into my editor and run directly using:

    python main.py

The goal is to make it super easy to:
- Paste the questionâ€™s solution code and tests
- Run everything in one file
- Replace with the next question later

Just give me a single working `main.py` script every time.
